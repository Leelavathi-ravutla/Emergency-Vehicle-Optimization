# Emergency-Vehicle-Optimization
The main objective of this project is to minimize the traffic congestion for the emergency vehicles by using sensors and connecting to network hospitals
We are using the sensors to detect the approach of an vehicle and sends signal to the control system to process the data and send commands to change the lights and clear the way
